# Statistics calculator

## What it is and who is it intended for



The purpose of the calculator is to allow for the 
calculations of different probability scenarios given
different input depending on the scenario or determining
different statistics given a set of data. The calculator
will benefit anyone who needs the probability of a 
scenario or some statistical measurement for themselves.

## Features
- The ability to input a set of data and to calculate
values from that set
- To determine the probability of an event 
x times in y trials given the probability of 
it occurring once, x and y 
(given each trial is independent).

## Why I chose this

As a statistics major, using multiple websites online
to calculate the numbers I need was a hassle, and I would
rather have access to the calculators I need in one
location. This will be useful for people that need
these specific statistical values.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to calculate a binomial
distribution
- As a user, I want to be able to input a set of raw data
- As a user, I want to be able to calculate specific
statistics from a set of raw data
- As a user, I want to be able to use a normal 
distribution model.
- As a user, I want to be able to save each calculator's calculation
I have done so far separately
- As a user, I want to be able to load a save I previously
made for each calculator

## Phase 4 task 3
If I had more time, 
- I would create an interface containing overlapping
methods between the model classes. Methods like the getters, setters and
some probability calculations do overlap, so having an interface would
help.
